# Age-Calculator for Blogger Website
This is an age calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows the user to input their date of birth and calculates their age in years, months, and days.

The HTML structure consists of a form with a label and input field for the date of birth, a button to trigger the age calculation, and a div to display the result. The CSS styling is used to create a visually appealing interface with a responsive design.

The JavaScript code defines a function to calculate the age based on the user input and the current date. It retrieves the user's input from the date input field, converts it to a Date object, and calculates the difference between that date and the current date. The resulting difference is then converted back to a Date object, from which the years, months, and days components are extracted using built-in JavaScript methods. Finally, the result is displayed in the designated result div using the innerHTML property.

The code also uses an event listener to trigger the age calculation function when the button is clicked.
